## âœ¨ Main purpose

The main purpose of this project was to **learn the basics of Vue**. In this case I wanted to replicate a web application to **add new tasks** to control the user workflow. You can perform several actions which include:

- Add or update the user data
- Add new task
- Search for a specific task by task title
- Filter task by column: number of task, title (alphabetically) or date

This application uses **Vuex** to manage the internal storage of the tasks as well as the user data and the search term input.

## ðŸ”¥ Set the project locally

To run the project locally you need to simply do the following:

- `git clone https://github.com/jgcarrillo/fct-control-vuejs.git`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

## ðŸš€ Netlify deployment

To deploy a **SPA** to Netlify you need to do the following steps:

- Create a new file in _public_ folder called `_redirects`
- Add `/* /index.html 200` to that file content
- In Netlify, set `vite build` and `dist` folder to deploy

You can check [this article](https://www.netlify.com/blog/how-to-deploy-vue-3-and-vite-app-in-5-minutes/) about deployment. If you are not going to use a SPA, you probably don't need to set the **redirects** rule

## ðŸŽ¢ Future improvements

As I said before, this is a dummy project to lear Vue, so several features could be added in the future to make the app more robust. Probably some of them are:

- [ ] Improve Tailwind CSS, mostly in non-desktop devices
- [ ] Better storage management
- [ ] Add a database (MongoDB, SQLite) to persist data
